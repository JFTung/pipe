# Transcript Formatting Guide

### Punctuation
- Do not use ellipses, except when dealing with direct quotes. An em dash,
  written with two hyphens in markdown, is preferred.
- Do not use parentheses or brackets of any kind. Use commas instead, as in the
  above sentence.
- Do not use slashes as shorthand for any word, such as "or, "and," or "per."
- Use exclamation points sparingly.

### Typography
- Avoid using bolding or underlining for emphasis. Italics are preferred.
- When referring to the title of the comic strip, *Garfield* should be
  italicized.
- *The Pipe Strip* must be italicized.
- Other works of art, such as Rembrandt's *Return of the Prodigal Son*, should
  also be italicized.

### Stutters and Stammers
- A stutter should be represented with a mid-word hyphen, "L-Like this!"
- A stammer should be represented with a hyphen trailing the repeated word,
  "When I see the world, the- the politics, the future, the- the satellites in
  space . . ."
